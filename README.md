# RESERVOIRES
Zhiqiang Jiang, in his ["Two Dimension Reduction Methods for Multi-Dimensional Dynamic Programming and Its Application in Cascade Reservoirs Operation Optimization"](https://scinapse.io/papers/2750306011) propose two optimization methods based on dynamic programming to solve in eficient manner the way to find the operation calendar of a cascade system reservoirs.
In this project I replicate Jiang methods and I make an implementation of them in MATLAB for [IMTA](https://www.gob.mx/imta).

The big challenge in this project was the inverse engineering developed in order to obtain similar results than those reported bu Jiang, since he only reports basic technical specifications of the reservoir systems leaving gaps not only on the available data to develop mass-energy balances to compute amounts of energy generated by the system, but also on details of application of methods for optimal computation of all amounts.
My strategy to achieve the mimetization of Jiang results was that used  on the study of natural complex systems, sending signals to the system and see its answer, in order to deduce the rules that rules the system.
